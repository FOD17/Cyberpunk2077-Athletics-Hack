# Cyberpunk2077-Athletics-Hack
This is some dank code to automate boosting your athletics.


# Notes about code as mentioned in video

## Importing
`import mouse,time, keyboard`
When it comes to these don't forget 
* pip3 install mouse
* pip install keyboard
into your terminal/cmd

## Modify Code
Change the value of punches to control how many 1-2 combos you throw. Base this off of your stamina: `punch(5)`
* found on line 28

Change the counter less than or equal to control how long it runs. On my CPU it takes about 46 seconds to do three times: `while counter <= 150:`
* found on line 27

Modify the sleep to recharge your stamina for the next round: `time.sleep(8)`
* found on line 34
