# Cyberpunk2077-Athletics-Hack
This is some dank code to automate boosting your athletics.

# How to use
Go up to a safe area from enemies, load up the script and run it. From there click back into the game. BUT MAKE SURE YOU ARE FACING A WALL!!!

To exit the game to run the code hit the windows button. If this does not work for your, then you need to modify the viewing in the settings to allow the windows button to kick you out of the game.


# Notes about code as mentioned in video

## Importing
`import mouse,time, keyboard`
When it comes to these don't forget 
* pip3 install mouse
* pip install keyboard
into your terminal/cmd

## Modify Code
Change the value of punches to control how many 1-2 combos you throw. Base this off of your stamina: `punch(5)`
* found on line 28

Change the counter less than or equal to control how long it runs. On my CPU it takes about 46 seconds to do three times: `while counter <= 150:`
* found on line 27

Modify the sleep to recharge your stamina for the next round: `time.sleep(8)`
* found on line 34
